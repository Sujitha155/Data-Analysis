# Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing the Iris dataset using popular data science libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's characteristics through data exploration, summary statistics, and visualizations.

# Overview

The Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers. This script performs the following tasks:

• Data Loading: The Iris dataset is loaded from seaborn.

• Data Exploration: Provides an initial preview of the dataset and details basic information.

• Summary Statistics: Computes central tendency, dispersion, and other summary statistics for numerical columns.

• Missing Values: Identifies any missing values present in the dataset.

• Data Visualization: Generates visualizations to illustrate the distribution of features and their correlations.

# Libraries Used

• pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

• numpy: For numerical operations.

• matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.

• seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

# Script Details

# Data Loading

The script loads the Iris dataset using the seaborn library.

# Data Exploration

It displays the first few rows of the dataset and provides basic information, including data types and non-null counts.

# Summary Statistics

The script calculates and displays mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and range for numerical columns in the dataset.

# Missing Values

It checks for and reports any missing values in the dataset.

# Data Visualization

• Distribution of Sepal Length: Visualizes the distribution of sepal length using a histogram with a kernel density estimate (KDE).

• Boxplot of Sepal Width: Illustrates the distribution of sepal width with a boxplot.

• Correlation Heatmap: Shows the correlation between numerical features using a heatmap.
